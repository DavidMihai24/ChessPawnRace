There is the possibility of introducing a gap (A-H) for each color. The players try to reach the last file of the board (Black, the first file, and White the 8th file) with one of their pawns; the first who is able to do so, wins.

Game modes: Player vs Player, Player vs Computer, or Computer vs Computer.

The Computer could be more built upon - it doesn't utilize the best possible move (idea: Minimax Algorithm).

Move notation (standard algebraic notation): c2-c4, or c2xd3 for Capture.
